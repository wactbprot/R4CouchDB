- writing Tests -> RUnit package provides infrastructure
-- thist should be the next step

- before returning the list the answer should be more evaluated

- function for view requests
-- done, but without params as ..?group=true
--- done

- sending _design/_/_view/_ by means of Duncans RJavascript
   http://www.omegahat.org/RJavaScript/outline.html

- post and update files
-- postFile done

-- skip postFile and updateFile out; this makes no sense
   since everyone knows best (better) how to handle with specific
   files resp. file structures ...

- give more consequent names to cdb list entry's, e.g. $noOfUuids is
  at least a $queryParam
-- done

- localhost is mostly not the right server; maybe it's a good idea to set a
  environment var
-- I think a better idea is to use the R CMD check procedure as a kind of unit
  test (see package notes in package Rd file)
--- bypass all functions by giving no serverName
---- done

- The convention for database naming should be implemented.
-- any API convention should be implemented

- before returning the list the answer should be more evaluated
-- try/catch for all curl calls


+++ after this is done I make a R package structure!
++++ done

- a function cdbDelDoc is missing
-- the function is called cdbDeletDoc
--- done (but not  testet well)

- replication?
